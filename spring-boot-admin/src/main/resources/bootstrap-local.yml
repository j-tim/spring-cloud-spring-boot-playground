      # For local development we are running the config server and service registry in Docker
      # but run spring-boot-admin in our IDEA.

      # We have to disable to resolve the config server via Eureka.
      # Because when going via the Service Registry to resolve the config server we will get the
      # docker internal ip address (on Windows and Mac OS) of the config server running in Docker.
      #
      # The local running application isn't running in Docker and can't reach the
      # internal ip of the config server.
      #
      # So to work around this issue we disable the discovery and go straight to the config server
      # that is running in Docker will is exposing it's port 8888 on the machine and is reachable
      # by the application running on in the IDEA on the machine.
